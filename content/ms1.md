**Reported Addresses**

This report contains **5 clusters totalling 192 addresses**. 

Of these, 17 were found by Chaos Labs and Nansen while the rest were missed. I have included the addresses found by LayerZero only for the purposes of validating the cluster (being of 20+ addresses and identical) and have clearly highlighted below the addresses missed by LayerZero.

While each cluster can stand alone and be proven independently, all addresses contained in each cluster were funded by the same address, on the same network, at the same time and for the same amount as demonstrated in this document. Given the clear and obvious connection between the clusters and the fact that the methodology used to find them was the same, I have included them all within this report for ease of access and to save on time.

While I have included all the evidence necessary to prove beyond any doubt that every account in each cluster is a sybil, if for whatever reason LayerZero does not agree on a particular cluster being a sybil, please do not discard the entire report.

**NOTE BEFORE: **This report was originally made by my Github account ?Mitsy1960? on 18 May 2024. I made 4 reports (one cluster per report). My Github account was inexplicably suspended two days later seemingly attacked by the sybil hacker groups who spam-reported every Github account that filed reports containing addresses connected with them or their users. I have taken the opportunity to add a further cluster, further details as well as screenshots to this report and I trust that it will be acceptable to the LayerZero team. The reward address used is the same as that submitted in my first Github report. My initial reports were:

- ?Issue #2550? ? ?Sybil Cluster Found (Partially found by LayerZero)

- ?Issue? #3150 ? ?Sybil Cluster of 33 Wallets?

- ?Issue #5758 ? ?Sybil Cluster of 43 Wallets?

- ?Issue #6126 ? ?Sybil Cluster of 48 Wallets?

The addresses are listed below in a copy-paste friendly table to allow you to manually verify everything in this report. The analysis of the addresses was imported from Excel as photos to save space on each page.

**Basis of overall findings (before individual clusters examined)**

I will prove that the reported addresses are sybils by a **two-stage analysis**. 

1. First, I will prove that all accounts in each cluster received funding from the same address, at the same time, on the same network, and often for the same amount (for some clusters this was precisely the same amount).

2. Second, I will prove that all accounts in each cluster share the same pattern of LayerZero activity i.e. they started farming LayerZero at the same time, they ended at the same time, they interacted with the same dapps at the same time and often with the same cargo as well. All accounts in each cluster share broadly the same stats as well such that when viewed side-by-side the connection between the accounts is obvious.

You will see that each stage is provable independently of the other and the combination of them rule out any possibility of a false positive. For example, a collection of addresses all being funded by the same account on the same network for the same amount may not in itself prove that such accounts are all connected ? they could be subject to a dusting acting (unlikely given the sums involved but possible. Similarly, a collection of addresses all sharing the exact same or almost the same activity on LayerZero over the same time period doesn?t necessarily mean that all accounts are connected either, many users may have followed ?farming guides? put out by twitter influencers and despite having only one account, they may well look identical to other users who are also totally independent.

However, the chances of both stages being conclusively met (same funding, same onchain activity) and these accounts all being individual users operating independently of one another is essentially nil.

**Stage 1: Funded by the same account**

All accounts received a deposit in ETH, often for the exact same amount from 0x888270Ff52f486729eF865466340D4eaC83a31D6, an account that appears to have been used to fund 10s of 1000s of accounts on the zkSync network within the space of two days 14 to 16 August 2023. These accounts went on to sybil farm both zkSync and LayerZero.

**Evidence of control by a singular entity:**

**All accounts** in **every cluster **received funding:

- From the same account being **31D6:**

- At the same time.

- For the exact same amount (or nearly the same).

- On the same network.

**Stage 2: All accounts share the same pattern of activity and onchain footprint within their cluster**

I will now go through each of the 5 clusters and show my findings.

**Description of cluster 1**

- 17 of the 20 accounts above were found by LayerZero ? but not all of them. 3 slipped through.

- All accounts first interaction with LayerZero was between 9-11 July 2023 **AND** used either Aptos Bridge or Stargate **AND **all or most transported 170 STG as cargo between Fantom and Avalanche for the route on Stargate **OR** Avalanche to Aptos on the Aptos Bridge. [Started the same]

- All accounts last interaction with LayerZero was approximately 8 April 2024 **AND **All accounts last three interactions with LayerZero were replicated being 1 x Shimmer Bridge, 1 x Interport Finance, 1 x Merkly on approximately the same dates **AND **used the same routes **AND **were followed by approximately 16 x Gas.zip transactions. [Ended the same]. 

- All accounts generated almost identical volume at approximately $17,350 USD volume.

- All accounts interacted with 16-19 contracts, 7-9 source chains and 32 destination chains with 6 active months. [Same onchain stats]

- All accounts follow a clear pattern of L0 interactions, at the same time, using the same dapps and this pattern is consistent throughout the cluster of reported addresses.

- Some degree of randomization present but when all accounts are viewed on LayerZeroscan the pattern of control by a single user is unavoidable as the probability of these accounts all sharing these criteria and **being funded by the same address** and still being independent users is infinitely small.

**Sybils part of the cluster but missed by LayerZero:**

![](/images/OaW_Image_10.png)

**Description of cluster 2**

- All accounts first interaction with LayerZero was 5 July 2023 **AND** used Stargate **AND **all or most used Binance to Avalanche or Binance to Fantom for the route. Each account made 4 or 5 bridging loops on Stargate in quick succession to start their LayerZero activity **AND **they all then used Testnet Bridge followed by BTC.b or vice versa. [Started the same]

- All accounts last interaction with LayerZero was in April 2024 **AND** they always used Womex 3-6 times successively to end their interactions with LayerZero **AND **were preceded by CoreDAO, Angel and Abracadabra Money transactions in different orders but always present. [Ended the same].

- All accounts generated either approximately $2100 USD volume or $20 USD volume.

- All accounts interacted with between 14 and 16 contracts, with 8 or 9 source chains and 13 or 14 destination chains. [Same onchain stats]. 

- All accounts follow a clear pattern of L0 interactions, at the same time, using the same dapps and this pattern is consistent throughout the cluster of reported addresses.

- Some degree of randomization present to avoid detection but when all accounts are viewed on LayerZero scan the pattern of control by a single user is unavoidable as the probability of these accounts all sharing these criteria and being **funded by the same address** and still being independent users is infinitely small.

**Description of cluster 3**

- All accounts first interaction with LayerZero was either 20 May or 21 May 2023 **AND** used Stargate **AND **all used Arbitrum to Optimism for the route. [Started the same]

- All or most accounts first 3 interactions with LayerZero were Stargate, then Testnet Bridge, then Aptos ? in that order and on the same day.

- All accounts last interaction with LayerZero (as at the snapshot date) was 3 x Stargate transactions **AND** they always occurred on 24 March 2024 and 2 April 2024. All accounts also carried out a final transaction on 1 May 2023 or 2 May 2023 also using Stargate but this was after the snapshot and is mentioned only for further proof they are all linked. [Ended the same].

- All or most accounts generated approximately between $5000 and $5500 USD in total volume

- All accounts interacted with between 21 and 22 contracts, with 8 source chains and 18 or 19 destination chains. All accounts shared 12 Active months. [Same onchain stats]. 

- All accounts bridged from Optimism to Gnosis using Omni X on 13 December 2023. [Unusual transaction replicated across all accounts]

- All accounts follow a clear pattern of L0 interactions, at the same time, using the same dapps and this pattern is consistent throughout the cluster of reported addresses.

- Some degree of randomization present to avoid detection but when all accounts are viewed on LayerZero scan the pattern of control by a single user is unavoidable as the probability of these accounts all sharing these criteria and being **funded by the same address** and still being independent users is infinitely small.

**Description of cluster 4**

- All accounts first interaction with LayerZero was either 2 July 2023 to 4 July 2023 **AND** used Stargate precisely 4 times **AND** all were followed by 1 x Testnet Bridge and 1 x Btc.b transaction. [Started the same]

- All or most accounts first 3 interactions with LayerZero were Stargate, then Testnet Bridge, then Btc.b ? in that order and on the same day.

- All or most accounts last interaction with LayerZero (as at the snapshot date) was 3 x Womex transactions **AND** they always occurred on 22 March 2024, 1 April 2024 and 8 April 2024. Reasonable attempts were made to vary the final interactions throughout the cluster but they almost always end with multiple Womex transactions. [Ended the same].

- All accounts interacted with between 14 and 18 contracts, with 8 to 9 source chains and 12 to 13 destination chains. All accounts shared 8 or 9 Active months. [Similar onchain footprint]. 

- All accounts bridged from Arbitrum to Goerli using Testnet Bridge on or around 18 August 2023. [Particular transaction replicated across all accounts]

- All accounts follow similar pattern of L0 interactions, at the same time, using the same dapps and this pattern is consistent throughout the cluster of reported addresses.

- Relatively heavy degree of randomization present to avoid detection but when all accounts are viewed on LayerZero scan the pattern of control by a single user is unavoidable as the probability of these accounts all sharing these criteria and being **funded by the same address** and still being independent users is infinitely small. The best proof aside from funding is the identical way each account was ?spun up? using 4 x Stargate transactions in quick succession.

**Description of cluster 5 [39]**

- All accounts first interaction with LayerZero was 25 May 2023 **AND** used Stargate precisely 4 times **AND** all were followed by 1 x Testnet Bridge and 1 x Btc.b transaction. [Started the same] This is the same pattern that Cluster 4 used which suggests they are controlled by the same user but spun up at different times to avoid detection. 

- All or most accounts first 3 interactions with LayerZero were Stargate, then Testnet Bridge, then Btc.b ? in that order and on the same day.

-  All accounts bridged from Optimism to Gnosis using Omni X on the **same day **13 December 2023 at the **same time**. [Unusual transaction replicated across all accounts] This is the same as Cluster 3 which strongly suggests Clusters 3 and 5 are the same user. 

- All or most accounts last interaction with LayerZero (as at the snapshot date) was 2 x Stargate transactions and either an L2Pass or Merkly transaction **AND** they always occurred on 4 or 5 March 2024, 26 or 30 March 2024 and 4 or 5 April 2024. Reasonable attempts were made to vary the final interactions throughout the cluster but they almost always end with final two stargate transactions. [Ended the same].

- All accounts interacted with between 20 to 22 contracts, with 8 source chains and 19 to 20 destination chains. All accounts shared 13 Active months. [Similar onchain footprint]. 

- All accounts follow similar pattern of L0 interactions, at the same time, using the same dapps and this pattern is consistent throughout the cluster of reported addresses.

- Relatively heavy degree of randomization present to avoid detection but when all accounts are viewed on LayerZero scan the pattern of control by a single user is unavoidable as the probability of these accounts all sharing these criteria and being **funded by the same address** and still being independent users is infinitely small. The best proof aside from funding is the identical way each account was ?spun up? using 4 x Stargate transactions in quick succession which is the same as Cluster 4.

**Detailed Methodology and Walkthrough**

I discovered what may be the central funding wallet for an industrial bot farm for farming zkSync. My thinking was that if this is a sybil farm for zkSync, it?s highly likely these sybils also farmed LayerZero as well ? and they did.

My method of initial detection of addresses was quite simple:

1. Using the zkSync Era explorer, I went to this address 0x888270Ff52f486729eF865466340D4eaC83a31D6 ? (referred to as ?**31D6? or the ?Sybil funding wallet? **throughout the document) and filtered the transactions by ?transfers?. 

![](/images/tjE_Image_43.png)

2. I went back in time to the earliest activity at page 1000. I started opening each receiving address in LayerZero scan to get a general idea as to how these wallets were transacting on the LayerZero network. I quickly found addresses that were identical or transacted in a clear pattern to wallets that I had just looked at.

3. I bookmarked these addresses and assigned them a ?cluster number? in the order that I detected them so I could keep track of every suspicious account for quick comparison when an account with a similar pattern was found.

Once I had a list of addresses that all appeared at first glance on LayerZero scan to be part of a sybil cluster, I did the following to confirm:

4. Open the earlier account/s in LayerZero Scan and do a side-by side comparison with three other accounts found in the same suspected cluster. Same usage pattern i.e. 4 x USDV, then 2 x Gas.zip, then 4 x Merkly etc? Approximately same total messages? Same bridging routes used with the same Dapps? Same spacing between transactions at the same time? Look into further.

5. Pick a handful of random transactions that appear replicated on each LayerZero scan page. Note the dapp used, the time each transaction was created, the cargo and amount transferred, the source and destination chains. When all of these factors match, it strongly suggests the accounts are part of the same cluster.

6. To confirm beyond doubt, I would check the first and last transactions on LayerZero to see if those are suspicious as well. All addresses overwhelmingly replicate the first and last interactions across the cluster i.e. the user started every wallet with 1 x Stargate or Aptos Bridge transactions followed by 5 or 6 more Stargate transactions on the same day, with the same 4 chains across 20+ accounts and always ended with 1 x ShimmerBridge, 1 x Interport Finance and 1 x Merkly transactions across the same time period. They started together ? they finished together.

![](/images/8hZ_Image_54.png)

7. Once 20 accounts had been identified, I would run the accounts from the through a tracker site to get a snapshot of the account?s interactions with LayerZero. This provided supporting matching statistics of volume, contracts interacted with, source and destination chains and days active which were the same or similar throughout.

I simply repeated this process for every wallet in every cluster that I have found to date.

Using this guide, you will be able to independently replicate my findings and satisfy yourselves that each account included in these clusters is in fact a sybil cluster containing at least 20 wallets of identical or nearly identical on chain activity, clearly under the control of the same entity. Some of the clusters do a better job at disguising themselves than others but I have personally verified each account in each cluster and I invite your team to do the same.
