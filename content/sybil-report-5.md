2. Description of report

This report was originally submitted via GitHub, and this is a resubmission with minor improvements. The reward address is the same as the bounty hunter address below.

a.   All the addresses mentioned above received transfers from the OKX hot wallet on the Arbitrum chain between May 24, 2023, and May 26, 2023,with amounts around 0.0060 ETH.

for example?

[https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xce36d27847c565c559046de61419e63169e24026917643a990b60de603addfec](null)

[https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x2023b65cca31b7cbca8fd80b5c4979fb87ab64ad46b0ef67d290b4d02d60b05f](https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x2023b65cca31b7cbca8fd80b5c4979fb87ab64ad46b0ef67d290b4d02d60b05f)

b.    All addresses received transfers of approximately 0.01 BNB from Binance hot wallets on the BNB chain between May 24, 2023, and May 26, 2023.

![](/images/X6T_Image_1.png)

c.   The first transaction related to l0 for all the addresses mentioned above occurred between May 25, 2023, and May 30, 2023

d.   The first transactions related to Stargate for all the mentioned addresses originated from the Arbitrum chain, with cross-chain amounts around $1000, and each underwent at least 10 Stargate cross-chain transactions. These transactions occurred between May 25, 2023, and May 30, 2023.

e.    All the mentioned addresses utilized the Holograph protocol once between May 25, 2023, and May 30, 2023, either crossing from AVAX to Polygon or from Polygon to AVAX.

f.   Between June 6, 2023, and June 11, 2023, all the addresses made use of the Aptos bridge once, with amounts ranging from $150 to $500.

g.   Between July 6, 2023, and July 11, 2023, all these addresses engaged in cross-chain transactions using Angle. The first transactions were from Polygon to Gnosis, involving small amounts. Subsequently, these addresses underwent multiple Angle cross-chain transactions, all involving small amounts.

H .   Because the transaction behaviors of these addresses are very similar, we can observe that the number of transactions related to l0 for these addresses ranges between 60 and 70, with the total transaction amount between 42,000 and 50,000. The active months are either 8 or 9, the source chains are 8, and the destination chains are 15 or 16.

These addresses exhibit high similarity on L0. For example, please check the following links:

3. Detailed methodology & walkthrough

 I carefully examined the data ([https://dune.com/springzhang/layerzero-users-ranking-for-potential-airdrop](https://dune.com/springzhang/layerzero-users-ranking-for-potential-airdrop)) on Dune  and found several datasets with very high similarity, such as consistent total cross-chain amounts, identical total transaction counts, and consistent active months. I used a web crawler to download the L0 data from Dune and stored it in MySQL. To obtain more of these homogeneous datasets, I utilized SQL query statements to search the downloaded data.The query conditions included similar amounts, transaction counts, the number of source chains, the number of target chains, and active months.

SELECT <code>name</code> FROM (https://dune.com/springzhang/layerzero-users-ranking-for-potential-airdrop)

WHERE Bridged Amount BETWEEN 42000.10 AND 50000.20            -- Similar Amounts

AND Transactions Count IN(54,56,57,58,59,60,61)     -- Similar Transaction Counts

AND Interacted Source Chains IN(8,7)                        -- Similar Interacted Source Chains

AND Destination Chains IN(15,16)                              -- Similar Destination Chains

AND Months IN(8,9)                                                  -- Similar Active Months

After the query, I obtained a set of relatively homogeneous data. Of course, this set of data may contain false positives, so to further accurately identify the Sybils, I put each address from this set into LayerZeroScan and manually checked whether these addresses had the same on-chain data, such as whether the first transaction on L0 occurred between May 25, 2023, and May 30, 2023, whether an approximately 0.006 ETH transaction was received on the Arbitrum chain from an OKX hot wallet between May 25, 2023, and May 26, 2023,whether Holograph was used once between May 25, 2023, and May 30, 2023, and whether Angle was used for cross-chain transactions between July 6, 2023, and July 11, 2023... Addresses without these consistent on-chain behaviors were excluded.

Through the above two rounds of filtering, I obtained a set of homogeneous addresses. Normal addresses interacting with each other cannot have such a high degree of similarity. The on-chain behaviors are similar (>80% similarity), the total cross-chain amounts on L0 are similar, the number of transactions on L0 is also similar, and they all received similar amounts during the period from May 24, 2023, to May 26, 2023, and made their first transaction on L0 during this period. Therefore, this set of addresses should be controlled by the same entity and considered as LayerZero Sybils.

4. Reward address

If eligible, please distribute 50% of the payout to each of these two wallets:

0x4C5403F9D47bd544c40B3eE605e6575a5c0795E7 (sponsor)

0x2f9ea89cc29cdbc59ce6481d99a87d49d0f25aba (bounty hunter)

This is a sponsored report. The sponsor and bounty hunter have mutually agreed on a 50/50 split of any rewards that this report is eligible for. The sponsor?s wallet submitting this report and paying the bond is 0x4C5403F9D47bd544c40B3eE605e6575a5c0795E7. The bounty hunter?s wallet for 50% payout if eligible is 0x2f9ea89cc29cdbc59ce6481d99a87d49d0f25aba . The bounty hunter has submitted a verified signature confirming the above to be true: [https://etherscan.io/verifySig/182375](https://etherscan.io/verifySig/182375).

These addresses received similar amounts of cryptocurrency from the same CEX for transaction gas before initiating l0 transactions. Here is the detailed analysis.

1 On the BNB chain, between May 24, 2023, and May 26, 2023, all addresses received approximately 0.01 BNB from Binance for gas on the BNB chain.
