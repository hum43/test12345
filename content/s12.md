2. Description of report

This is a Sybil cluster containing 42 addresses. Most of these had similar volumes of more than $10.000, sometimes having 10, 20, or even up to 40 transactions in some cases.

3. Detailed methodology & walkthrough, supported by screenshots of Arkham, LayerZeroScan, DeBank, block explorers, etc to support arguments

From now on, I'll refer to the wallets listed on this cluster according to the table given below. Details like the obtention of the first address, the relation between the wallets and their behavior will be explained in a moment.

Now, How did I get the first address in the first place?,  you see, I have looked at two specific blacklists like Optimism [List of filtered addresses](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oTIssTVDkrLi33N6nHIiA8-AMGZ-W6McQFzPRcl0IZ4/edit?pli=1#gid=0) and Hop [eliminatedSybilAttackers](https://github.com/hop-protocol/hop-airdrop/blob/master/src/data/eliminatedSybilAttackers.csv), then, I used a KNIME workflow that would basically:

1. Load and clean up the list of OP airdrop excluded addresses.

2. Compare and only include addresses that were filtered by both OP and HOP.

3. Exclude the addresses that were part of Layerzero's [initial list](https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/sybil-report/blob/main/initialList.csv.zip).

4. Filter which of those addresses used Layerzero according to their recent [data](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/m0ji3zbmbockvqkyl9353/ALYUg0-rLU2fuDMSd9nuB34?rlkey=kdu7zf877k919c34t754nxerc&st=9t45y59t&dl=0).

![](/images/35d_Image_1.png)

In which, out of 17101 blacklisted addresses from OP and 14195 blacklisted addresses from HOP:

- 2204 addresses were flagged from both airdrops.

- Only 61 of those addresses were excluded from Layerzero airdrop.

- 169 addresses flagged by both OP and HOP didn't appear on the initial list.

From that list of 169 addresses, one of them was chosen randomly, and that's how Address #1 was chosen.

Now, starting with the methodology used for discovering each of the nodes it was necessary to use the Arkham Intelligence[ ](https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/visualizer)[visualizer](https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/visualizer) tool in order to see the relations between addresses.

![](/images/31n_Image_2.png)

Now, How could be explored and found the different nodes of the Sybil cluster?

I used an algorithm that will focus on exploring the entities and their related connections from left (receiver's end) to right (sender's end), and do the following verifications:

1. The entity cannot be a contract.

2. The entity is related to the current node, be it by sending or receiving funds from it.

3. The entity has used Layerzero.

4. The entity did transaction spam during a certain day or set of days (the most recent date is referenced on the table).

In order to verify steps 3 and 4, it was necessary to use MoDeFi's[ ](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/MoDeFi/layerzero-snapshot-overview-vE3quB?tabIndex=2)[tool](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/MoDeFi/layerzero-snapshot-overview-vE3quB?tabIndex=2) which gives a breakdown of an address volume, transactions and interactions with Layerzero.

![](/images/oAR_Image_3.png)

![](/images/WIE_Image_4.png)

We can see for example, how Address #2 on March 27th, 2024 used Stargate twice to bridge from Arbitrum -> Polygon -> Avalanche, then used Angle six times to transact between Avalanche -> Gnosis -> Optimism -> Base -> BNB Chain -> Polygon -> Arbitrum, everything within the span of less than 2 hours.

![](/images/Qjo_Image_5.png)

Address #4 was doing something similar on the same day and even continued this suspicious pattern a day after on March 28th.

![](/images/o1f_Image_6.png)

![](/images/Z1O_Image_7.png)

Address #3 was also doing transaction spam on March 25th.

![](/images/tcz_Image_8.png)

If an entity or potential node was at the left or right of a current node, and had this type of behavior, it would be immediately pinned to the graph.

![](/images/2Hh_Image_9.png)

As you could see, many of these addresses were doing the same instances of transaction spam on dates very close to each other.

There were instances of addresses that used Layerzero and didn't do spam (Like #1 and #38), but these wallets were related to other addresses doing spam nonetheless

Despite Arkham being able to notice these relations and the interactions with other addresses and protocols, it has some current limitations that wouldn't let a link with a prompt of a 42 wallet Sybil cluster be seen without throwing Error 431.

Now, starting with the highlights, and after putting all of the nodes together, the final graph would look like the following:

![](/images/box_Image_10.png)

The flow of transactions is shown in this other graph according to information from the table and Arkham.

![](/images/RWm_Image_11.png)

This is just a graphic version of the table shown above and it shows many different patterns, like for example Wallet #18 spreading funds towards wallets #23, #24, #25 and

26, or how a sequence would go like Wallet #11, #10, #4, #3 and #1.
The correlation between the wallets could be evidenced more clearly, thanks to another tool made by[ ](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/MoDeFi/wallets-correlation-finder-self-report-helper-i85VhJ)[MoDeFi](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/MoDeFi/wallets-correlation-finder-self-report-helper-i85VhJ).

![](/images/X4J_Image_12.png)

All of these nodes had received funds from OKX Exchange.

![](/images/164_Image_13.png)

By expanding the OKX entity, it could be evidenced that there were many addresses funding various nodes.

![](/images/5ce_Image_14.png)

Two examples from the entities that are located to the center of the graph and have funded many addresses from the cluster would be:

- Address 0x06959153B974D0D5fDfd87D561db6d8d4FA0bb0B sending funds to Addresses #8, #16, #17, #19, #22, #24, #28, #36 and #37.

- Address 0x62383739D68Dd0F844103Db8dFb05a7EdED5BBE6 sending funds to Addresses #18, #13, #37, #10, #3, #12, #28, #3, #30, #31, #32, #42.



Most of these addresses exploited Stargate by doing the instances of spam mentioned above.

![](/images/FUE_Image_15.png)

It is also worth noting how they received funds from Layerzero's bridge, further ratifying the exploitation of dApps from Layerzero's ecosystem to secure a high volume (which is similar between some cluster wallets) and then claim an overtly high amount of rewards in exchange, which results in a detriment to the project overall.

![](/images/NwY_Image_16.png)

![](/images/ems_Image_17.png)

According to that data:

- Addresses #1 and #21 were both flagged by OP and HOP, but not by Layerzero (part of the 169 addresses mentioned before).

- Addresses #7, #10, #13, #15, #27 and #37 were flagged by OP.

- Addresses #4, #12, #17, #18, #25 and #38 were flagged by HOP.

So, there is a guarantee that 14 out of these 42 addresses were already flagged as Sybil.
